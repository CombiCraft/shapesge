## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.4] - 2023-12-14

### Fixed
- Correct initial size for `Stvorec`

## [2.0.3] - 2023-12-08

### Fixed

- Fixed regression in key events handling introduced in 2.0.2 by migrating from JPanel
  to Canvas component.

### Other changes

- Mentioning rotation direction in the `Image`/`Obrazok` documentation

## [2.0.2] - 2023-12-07

### Changed
- Rendering is now done using double buffer strategy instead of standard
  repaining of the canvas. This should improve performance and make
  fullscreen more reliable.

### Fixed

- Correct screen marked as default for a fullscreen rendering when multiple screens
  are available

## [2.0.1] - 2023-11-30

### Fixed
- Fixed exception while rotating `Image`/`Obrazok`

## [2.0.0] - 2023-11-28

### Added
- Image resource can be loaded once and used in multiple `Image`/`Obrazok` instances
  using `ImageData`/`DataObrazku` classes
- Every shape can be moved to specific position by using `changePosition`/`zmenPolohu`.
  Important: this method specifies the position of anchor point the same way
  as using the constructor does instead of specifying the position of the center
  as it does for `Obrazok` class in the original tvary project.

### Changed
- `Text` class renamed to `TextBlock` (english API) and `BlokTextu` (slovak API) to 
  differentiate names between localizations
- `FontStyle` enum renamed to `StylFontu` in the slovak API
- `ExitOnClose` configuration option replaced by `OnClose` = `hide`/`exit`/`nothing`/`send` message.

### Fixed
- Key events with key modifiers are parsed correctly
- Timer work correctly even when its frequency is lower than FPS

### Other changes
- Big refactoring to decouple public API from actual implementation.
  This allows us to merge both slovak and english APIs to the one
  branch.
- Fixed javadoc documentation

## [1.2.0] - 2023-03-13
