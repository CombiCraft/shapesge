/**
 * Manager is the master class behind managing objects in your game.
 * <p>
 *     Its job is to:
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>handle keyboard input</li>
 *         <li>handle mouse movement and input</li>
 *         <li>handle timers</li>
 *     </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     You can configure the Manager's behavior in your {@code sbge.ini} file.
 *     You can find the setup instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/infjava/shapesge/wiki">ShapesGE Wiki on GitHub</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>You can create and use multiple Managers throughout your game.</p>
 * <p>
 *     <u>IMPORTANT NOTE:</u> It is possible to make a single object managed multiple times, either by the same Manager, or multiple different Managers.
 *     This may lead to unexpected behavior, for example:
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>Your character takes two or more steps on one keypress.</li>
 *         <li>Objects move through the game's window faster than they should.</li>
 *         <li>More objects than expected are created on keypress.</li>
 *         <li>Basically, all other quirks in input and timing.</li>
 *     </ul>
 * </p>
